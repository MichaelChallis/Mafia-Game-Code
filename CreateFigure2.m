%  Notes
%  -----
%  1)  This analysis computes the performance of Braverman et al. (2009)
%      strategy for playing the game Mafia, and also computes the superior
%      Modified Braverman Strategy.
%
%  2)  The work of Braverman et al. (2009) is described in,
%                  Braverman, M., Etesami, O., & Mossel, E. (2008)
%                  Mafia: A theoretical study of players and coalitions in
%                  a partial information environment.
%                  Annals of Applied Probability, 18, 825â€“846.
%
%  3)  The Modified Braverman Stratgey in described in the pre-print,
%                  Challis, M.J. (2025)
%                  Revised theory and modeling of the the Optimal
%                  strategies in the game Mafia.
